create function showPage
    pass in 'list' which is the student data passed to the function
    pass in 'page' which represents the page number passed to the function

    set startIndex to be index of first item to be displayed ((page*items per page)-items per page)
    set endIndex to be the index of the last item to be displayed (page*items per page)

    set list to select the ul with className student-list
    set list.innerHTML to empty string

    for each item whose index is >= startIndex and < endIndex  
        create DOM elements to display the information for each student (example in instructions)
    endfor

    add elements that have been created to the ul with classname student-list

closefunction showPage

create function pageButtons
    pass in 'list' which is the student data passed to the function
    set numberOfButtons to a calculation of list.length/9

    set linkList to the ul with class of link-list
    set linkList.innerHTML to ""

    for each page that we need to create
        create DOM elements to display the pagination buttons
    endfor

    add elements created to the linkList
    
    set firstButton to first pagination button we just created
    get firtButton a class name of active

    add eventListener for clicks on the linkList items
        conditional ensuring only pagination button clicks cause effects
        remove active className from all buttons
        set className of current button to active
        call showPage using parameters of list and page number


closefunction pageButtons

FOR PAGINATION buttons//something strange happens when selecting last button, look at #ofbuttons calculation
possibly need another conditional in the for loop that creates LI student items
checks for undefined in some key before going along and generating the item, otherwise, breaks the loop?
